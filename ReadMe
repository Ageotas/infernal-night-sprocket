Hi _flx,

Time for some GM48 madness!!

I have set up a new project with nothing in it but two empty rooms; one rm_title and one rm_epilogue. This is mostly just to make sure that I have done all the "git" stuff correctly... and it looks like I have!

This message is whatever is contained in the ReadMe file, so when you edit that it is reflected on the default landing page here.

Of course, the greatest part of git that we have never had to use before? We can always revert back to this state if we eff it up ;)
